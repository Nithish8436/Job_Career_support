AI IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=========================
Service File: `backend/services/aiService.js`

1. CORE TECHNOLOGY
------------------
- Provider: Groq Cloud API (`https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`)
- Model: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (High performance, low latency text generation)
- Library: `axios` (used for standard HTTP POST requests to Groq).

2. KEY AI FUNCTIONS
-------------------

A. `callGroqAI(messages, model)`
   - The low-level wrapper that sends the payload to Groq.
   - Handles errors and logs response status.
   - Input: Array of message objects `[{ role: 'user', content: '...' }]`.

B. `chatWithAI(message, history)`
   - Purpose: Handles the interactive Chat Coach.
   - System Prompt: 
     - "You are an experienced generic Career Coach."
     - Rules: Keep answers short (2-3 sentences), PLAIN TEXT only.
     - App Knowledge: Contains specific context about "This Career Support Platform" features.
   - Context Handling: 
     - Accepts a `history` array.
     - Detects uploaded Resume text (injected as a System message) to answer specific questions like "What are my skills?".

C. `analyzeMatch(resumeText, jobDescription)`
   - Purpose: Resume Scoring.
   - System Prompt: "You are an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System)..."
   - Output Constraint: Strict JSON format `{ score, matchingSkills, missingSkills, tips }`.
   - Logic: Compares the Resume Text vs Job Description Text.

D. `generateInterviewFeedback(answer, question)`
   - Purpose: Mock Interview Feedback.
   - Prompt: "Evaluate this candidate's answer..."
   - Output: Feedback string + 1-10 Rating.

3. PROMPT ENGINEERING STRATEGIES
--------------------------------
- **JSON Enforcement**: For analysis tasks, we strictly instruct the AI to return *only* valid JSON parsing. We use regex cleaning to extract the JSON if the AI gets chatty.
- **Context injection**: For uploads, we inject the file content as a `system` message: "RESUME CONTEXT: ...". This makes the LLM 'aware' of the document without fine-tuning.
- **Role Persona**: We set distinct personas ("Strict ATS", "Friendly Coach") depending on the feature being used.
