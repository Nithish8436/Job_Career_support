PROJECT ERROR LOG & RESOLUTIONS
=================================

This document tracks the major technical challenges faced during development and their solutions.

1. CRITICAL: 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR IN CHAT
   - **Issue**: The `chatWithAI` function in `aiService.js` was crashing because it tried to call `callGroqAI`, which was missing (undefined).
   - **Cause**: A previous manual edit or merge accidentally deleted the `callGroqAI` function definition.
   - **Solution**: Restored the `callGroqAI` function from a previous version/backup into `aiService.js`.

2. FEATURE: AI NOT RECOGNIZING UPLOADED RESUME
   - **Issue**: Users would upload a resume in the Chat, but when asking questions about it, the AI would say "Please upload your resume."
   - **Cause**: 
     1. The resume text was not being extracted and sent to the frontend.
     2. The frontend was not passing this text to the AI context.
     3. The AI system prompt did not explicitly know it could handle uploads.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Modified `backend/routes/upload.js` to return the extracted text in the API response.
     2. Modified `frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.jsx` to store this text in a state variable (`resumeContext`).
     3. Updated `ChatPage.jsx` to inject this text as a "system" message at the START of the chat history for every request.
     4. Updated `aiService.js` prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to use uploaded files.

3. UI/UX: CHAT FORMATTING ISSUES
   - **Issue**: Chat messages were displaying as vertical bullet points, which looked cluttered.
   - **Cause**: `ReactMarkdown` was using custom components (`ul`, `li`) that enforced a specific list style.
   - **Solution**: Removed the custom component overrides in `ChatPage.jsx` to allow standard text rendering.

4. UI/UX: INCORRECT AI RESPONSE LENGTH
   - **Issue**: AI responses were too long and structured (Headings, Bullet points), which the user found overwhelming.
   - **Cause**: The system prompt requested detailed analysis.
   - **Solution**: Modified `aiService.js` system prompt to strictly enforce "2-3 short sentences" and "plain text only."

5. CONFIGURATION: UNUSED TEST FILES
   - **Issue**: The project contained clutter from multiple test scripts (`test_ai.js`, etc.) and unused routes (`/api/test`).
   - **Cause**: Development artifacts left over.
   - **Solution**: Deleted all root-level test scripts and removed the `/api/test` route from `server.js` and the filesystem.

6. CONTENT: PROJECT NAMING
   - **Issue**: The AI referred to the project as "Delta Forge", but the user requested anonymity for the brand.
   - **Solution**: Updated the AI system prompt to refer to the project generic "This Career Support Platform".

PREVIOUS/HISTORICAL ISSUES:
---------------------------
7. LOGIN/REGISTER UI STYLING
   - **Issue**: Basic UI.
   - **Solution**: Revamped with highly visual, animated designs using Framer Motion and modern Tailwind classes.

8. PDF LAYOUT ISSUES
   - **Issue**: Downloaded Resume PDFs had broken layouts.
   - **Solution**: Adjusted HTML/CSS generation logic to ensure proper page breaks and styling suitable for `puppeteer`/`html-to-pdf` rendering.
